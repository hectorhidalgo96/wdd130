        <p>Utah is an amazing mix of wild, diverse landscapes, from the snow-capped peaks of the Wasatch Mountains near
            Salt Lake
            City to the breathtaking red-rock deserts of the south. It's a huge playground for outdoor enthusiasts, with
            incredible
            skiing in the winter and endless opportunities for hiking, biking, and exploring national parks like Zion
            and Arches
            when the weather is warm. Many people are drawn to the state's family-friendly, community-focused culture
